# 🖼️ IMAGE-BASED-SEARCH-ENGINE

Welcome to the **Image-Based Search Engine** — a cutting-edge visual search system that flips the traditional search paradigm. Instead of entering text queries, users simply upload an image, and the engine intelligently retrieves visually or contextually similar images from a preloaded dataset.

This project showcases how modern computer vision and feature extraction techniques can revolutionize the way we search, discover, and interact with visual data.

📄 **[Official Project Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PthTos6DVZz7gy5lTqu-sWbmXABUSlkN/view?usp=sharing)**

## 🚩 Key Features

- 🔍 **Image as Input**: Search begins with an image, not a keyword.
- 🧠 **Deep Feature Extraction**: Utilizes deep learning to extract robust visual features.
- ⚡ **Efficient Similarity Matching**: Quickly finds the most contextually relevant results.
- 🖼️ **Dataset-Based Retrieval**: Results are fetched from a predefined image dataset.
- 🧩 **Modular Architecture**: Clean and extensible codebase for easy experimentation and upgrades.

## 🧩 File Breakdown

### `feature_extractor.py`
- Extracts high-level features from images using a pretrained CNN model.
- Converts images to fixed-length feature vectors for comparison.

### `offline.py`
- Preprocesses all dataset images.
- Extracts and stores features in a serialized format (e.g., `.pkl`, `.npy`) for fast retrieval.

### `server.py`
- Launches a Flask web server.
- Receives an image from the frontend, extracts its features, compares them to the dataset, and returns similar images.
- **Note:** Ensure the HTML interface is correctly linked by updating the path to `index.html`.

```python
# In server.py
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__, template_folder='.')

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template("index.html")
```

This setup serves the `index.html` file from the root directory, enabling users to interact with the visual search engine via the browser.

## ▶️ How to Run

Follow these steps to set up and launch the Image-Based Search Engine locally:

### 📦 1. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python installed (preferably 3.7 or above), then install required packages:

```bash
pip install tensorflow flask numpy pillow
```

### 🏗️ 2. Preprocess the Dataset

Use `offline.py` to extract and store features from the dataset images:

```bash
python offline.py
```

This will:
- Load all images from `./static/img/`
- Extract features using `FeatureExtractor`
- Save the `.npy` feature files into `./static/feature/`

### 🚀 3. Start the Flask Server

Run the backend server with:

```bash
python server.py
```

By default, the app will be hosted at:  
**http://0.0.0.0:5000/**

### 🌐 4. Access the Frontend

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:5000/
```

You can now upload an image and view the top visually similar images retrieved from the dataset!

## 📂 Dataset Structure

All dataset images used for search and retrieval should be stored in the following directory:

```
./static/
│
├── img/             # Folder containing all dataset images
├── feature/         # Folder where precomputed image features (.npy) are stored
├── uploaded/        # Folder where user-uploaded query images are temporarily saved
```

### Folder Details

- **`img/`**:  
  Place your dataset images here. These will be indexed by `offline.py` and used for comparison.

- **`feature/`**:  
  Automatically generated by `offline.py`. Stores the feature vectors of dataset images in `.npy` format.

- **`uploaded/`**:  
  When a user uploads an image through the web interface, it's temporarily stored here for processing.

⚠️ Ensure all folders exist before running the server. You can create them manually if needed:

```bash
mkdir -p static/img static/feature static/uploaded
```

## 🖼️ Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of a collection of images that the system uses to retrieve visually similar results based on input queries.

To maintain transparency and reproducibility, the dataset has been made publicly available.

📁 **[Download the Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18qAlnvfo1WDzdJ6JjD4D3xXiSoiSg0bp?usp=sharing)**

### Instructions:
1. Download the images from the link above.
2. Place them into the `./static/img/` directory of the project.
3. Run `offline.py` to generate and store feature vectors for all images.

Once this setup is complete, the search engine will be ready to find matches based on visual similarity!
